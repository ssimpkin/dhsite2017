Most things happen somewhere, and mapping can be an effective technique for exploring, analysing, and presenting many types of data. This workshop is designed for researchers who are interested in adding a spatial dimension to their research.


In this two part workshop, participants will be introduced to Geographic Information Systems (GIS) techniques from a humanist’s perspective. Starting from primary sources, participants will learn how to extract spatial “clues” from many types of primary sources, create GIS-friendly data, transform addresses and place names into coordinates and web maps, use georectification techniques to bring digitized historical maps onto webmaps, and learn about online exhibit-building tools that incorporate spatial data.


The workshop was first presented at [Digital Humanities Summer Institute: Technologies East (DHSITE)](https://dhsite.org/) in Ottawa on May 17-18, 2017. Feedback is welcome!
