## Workshop structure

In part one, we’ll learn more about the properties of geospatial data and some common formats you may encounter. We’ll then extract geospatial data clues from historical sources (in this case, a city directory), build a data table with attribute information in [Google Sheets](http://sheets.google.com) with the [Geocode by Awesome Table](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/geocode-by-awesome-table/cnhboknahecjdnlkjnlodacdjelippfg?hl=en) add-on, and create geospatial data from the points in [geojson.io](https://geojson.io).


Next, we’ll take a look at how analog maps can be brought into the digital world through georectification using [Map Warper](https://mapwarper.net/). I’ll also briefly introduce some tools for building online exhibits with a spatial component, including [Neatline](http://neatline.org/) and [StoryMap JS](https://storymap.knightlab.com/).


If there's enough time, we'll take a look at [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/), an open-source web mapping library that can display raster and vector data.


## Theme

Since [Digital Humanities Summer Institute: Technologies East (DHSITE)](https://dhsite.org/) is based in Ottawa, I’ve chosen to use historical data from this city in the tutorial exercises. Special thanks to Library and Archives Canada and the GSG Centre at the University of Ottawa for these materials.
