## Overview

Several online exhibit-building tools incorporate spatial data. In this module, we'll review some of the most common examples used in digital humanities projects (circa 2017). 

## [Neatline](http://neatline.org/)

This Omeka add-on was designed to build place-based narratives that are well-integrated with Omeka collections. It is maintained by the [Scholars’ Lab](http://scholarslab.org/) at the University of Virginia Library.

- Example: [Georges E. Michaud : Souvenirs d'un grand homme](http://biblio.uottawa.ca/omeka2/jwatson/exhibits/show/archives-uottawa/georges-michaud) by Lysanne Brazeau, Sophie Cayer and Ariane Pelletier as part of the [ISI6354 Cultural Heritage Resources](http://biblio.uottawa.ca/omeka2/jwatson/) course taught by Jada Watson.
- Example: [Shakespearean street names and places in Stratford, Ontario](http://216.48.92.16/omeka1/shakespearecanada/neatline/fullscreen/shakespeare-place-names-in-stratford-ontario) by Nagin Zabihi, Celine Baker and Ruth Truong as part of the [ENG 4142 seminar course "How Shakespeare Became 'Shakespeare'”](http://biblio.uottawa.ca/omeka1/shakespearecanada/) taught by Irene Makaryk and Amanda Montague.

### Features

- Can use web maps, scanned images and georectified maps for the background. For more information about including maps you’ve georectified using Map Warper, see [this tutorial by Kristen Mapes](http://www.kristenmapes.com/neatline/).
- Integrates well with items that have been uploaded and described in Omeka.
- Can annotate the background image with points, lines, and polygons.
- Has an optional timeline feature.

### Installation

- Requires Omeka, which in turn requires a server environment with PHP (5.2.11 or greater), MySQL (5.0 or greater), and Apache.
- The University of Ottawa Library hosts Omeka sites for researchers who are affiliated with the University. Please contact me for more information.



## [StoryMap JS](https://storymap.knightlab.com/)

This platform for building map-based exhibits was developed by the [Knight Lab](http://knightlab.northwestern.edu/) at Northwestern University. It works in your web browser and can be accessed with a Google account.

- Example: [A Company of Fools: The tradition of Shakespeare in the park and its reception in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada](https://uploads.knightlab.com/storymapjs/7d098f4b0a8c4f33a03b9f51a2c8fbcb/alex-is-playing/index.html) by Katelyn Boros, Alexandria Jacobs and Stephanie Kramer as part of the [ENG 3133 "Elizabethan Shakespeare" course]](http://biblio.uottawa.ca/omeka1/shakespearecanada/) taught by Irene Makaryk and Amanda Montague.
- Example: [Shakespeare in the North](https://uploads.knightlab.com/storymapjs/a122420d2418de9e368a5d8813632deb/shakespeare-in-the-north/index.html) by Maggie Kendall, Andrea Zehr and Krystyna Dodds as part of the [ENG 4142 seminar course "How Shakespeare Became 'Shakespeare'”](http://biblio.uottawa.ca/omeka1/shakespearecanada/) taught by Irene Makaryk and Amanda Montague.

### Features

- Options for image-based backgrounds and web maps.
- Easy to use, no installation required.

### Installation

- Hosted by the Knight Lab. Exhibits can be embedded on websites. 
- Requires a Google account to log in.


## Additional tools

- [Palladio](http://hdlab.stanford.edu/palladio/) is a suite of data visualization tools that allow you to map the relationships between different objects.
- [Esri Story Maps](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/en/) allows you to create compelling narratives using real geospatial data. It is integrated with the ArcGIS Online platform and features several templates.
